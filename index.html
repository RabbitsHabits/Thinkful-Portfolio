          </header>
            <p>I am an aspiring software developer, living in Port St. Lucie, Florida.</p>
            <p>As a young developer, I am interested in:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Learning how professionals work.</li>
              <li>Understanding the culture in development.</li>
              <li>Getting to know my fellow developers.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Enjoy my website which I will hopefully be updating as I get better.</p>

            <h2>What You Should Know About Me</h2>
          </header>
          <p>When I was going to college I was initially taking graphic design classes, as they tickled the creative part of my mind. I took a programming class as I believed it important to be literate with technology regardless of if I'd be directly programming or not. The class ended up clicking with me and I pivoted towards programming as it engaged me far more than any of my graphic design classes had. Now I am learning with Thinkful.com to become a fullstack web developer.</p>
          <p>Outside of programming I'm a big fan of video games and as popular of a hobby as that is now it still warrents a mention. The games I've spent the most time with rank out something like this:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>League of Legends</li>
            <li>Warframe</li>
            <li>Terraria</li>
            <li>Final Fantasy XIV</li>
            <li>Path of Exile</li>
          </ol>
